      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating a resilient security program that meets industry standards is crucial for today’s organizations, especially with the rising expectations around data security and regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, Security Managers, GRC Specialists, and technology professionals, aligning with established frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and SOC 2 controls provides a solid foundation for protecting sensitive data and ensuring trust with clients and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog will outline how to build a security program that effectively aligns with both NIST and SOC 2, leveraging the strengths of each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rethinking GRC: How CISOs Can Keep Up With Growing Demands</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the digital threat landscape evolves, &lt;strong&gt;Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)&lt;/strong&gt; has become an essential focus for every CISO. But managing GRC today feels like juggling endless responsibilities—compliance demands, security risks, and resource constraints—all while trying to protect your organization. Traditional GRC approaches aren’t cutting it anymore. They’re slow, inflexible, and often prioritize compliance over actual security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key challenge is &lt;strong&gt;decoupling compliance from security&lt;/strong&gt;. Compliance frameworks, while necessary, shouldn’t dictate how you manage security risks. Passing audits doesn’t mean your organization is secure. CISOs need to focus on real threats and risks, letting compliance be a byproduct of effective security rather than the driver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
