Inspired by [Phil Venables‚Äô Good CISO / Bad CISO framework](https://www.philvenables.com/post/good-ciso---bad-ciso), this analysis explores the mental models that separate effective security leaders from reactive ones.

With over a decade of experience in cybersecurity, I currently serve as an Information Security Lead on the path to Deputy CISO, advising senior executives on risk, resilience, and security strategy. I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Cybersecurity, multiple industry certifications across security, and bring hands-on expertise across cloud, application, and enterprise security domains.

Beyond my corporate role, I‚Äôm a founder, mentor, and speaker, dedicated to developing the next generation of security leaders and bridging the gap between technical depth and executive strategy. My career focus: turning security into a business advantage by aligning technology, culture, and systems with organizational priorities

Phil Venables‚Äô recent piece lays out a powerful contrast that every security leader should reflect on. What struck me most is how often the ‚Äúbad‚Äù traits aren‚Äôt about incompetence, but about systems and environments that push CISOs into narrow, reactive postures.

## The Mental Models That Matter

![Good CISO vs. Bad CISO: The Hidden Mindsets That Make or Break Security Leadership](/posts/os-weekly/images/good-ciso-bad-ciso-25.png)

### Flywheel vs. Fire Station

- A good CISO builds compounding systems (think AWS‚Äôs ‚Äúsecurity is everyone‚Äôs job‚Äù model).  
- A bad one runs from incident to incident, counting tickets.

### Leverage vs. Force

- The best CISOs scale through automation, influence, and culture.  
- The worst rely on brute force and more tools.

### Hazard + Outrage

Risk isn‚Äôt just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs how stakeholders feel about it. Ignoring perception is how small issues spiral into crises.

## Executive Level (Vision & Accountability)

- **Action Item:** Frame board updates around business resilience and trust capital, not just vulnerabilities patched.  
  - *Example:* ‚ÄúOur phishing resilience improved by 30%‚Äîwhich directly reduces potential fraud losses by $XM.‚Äù

- **Action Item:** Teach boards meta-questions‚Äîe.g., ‚ÄúWhat assumptions are we making about our cloud dependencies?‚Äù

## Strategic Level (Systems & Scale)

- **Action Item:** Create a security champions network inside engineering‚Äîlike Atlassian does‚Äîso security knowledge compounds instead of bottlenecking in one team.

- **Action Item:** Leverage procurement. Instead of buying another monitoring tool, push SaaS providers to meet higher security baselines. That single act scales security far beyond the org.

## Operational Level (Culture & Execution)

- **Action Item:** Build a ‚Äúbad news travels fast‚Äù norm. At one firm I‚Äôve seen, engineers are rewarded for surfacing risky misconfigs early‚Äîbefore they hit production.

- **Action Item:** Document repeatable decisions (risk registers, FAQ playbooks) so teams aren‚Äôt reinventing the wheel. This creates durable clarity and reduces cognitive load.

> **Insight:** The real risk is not ‚ÄúBad CISOs‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs organizations that force even good ones into firefighting. Without the right mental models and structures, strategy collapses into tools, excuses, and short-term wins.

So the thought I‚Äôll leave the room with: **What systems can we design so that staying strategic isn‚Äôt an act of heroism for CISOs, but the default mode of operation?**
