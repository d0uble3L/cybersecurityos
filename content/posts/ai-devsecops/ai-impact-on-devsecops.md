As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, its profound implications for these practices offer unprecedented opportunities to further strengthen our security posture and streamline processes.

In this post I will focus on the transformative integration of DevSecOps and how the shift-left philosophy has fundamentally enhanced how organizations approach security throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Understanding DevSecOps and Shifting Left

DevSecOps integrates security practices within the DevOps process, ensuring that security is a shared responsibility throughout the software development lifecycle.

Take a look at this real work example - Deploying a web application on AWS EC2: [CI/CD Pipeline with Security Checks](https://github.com/d0uble3L/webapp).

### High Level Overview

This CI/CD pipeline deploys a Java application (`target/WebApp.war`) on a Tomcat web server. It incorporates security checks as part of a DevSecOps approach.

Shifting left means addressing security concerns earlier in development, which helps to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate risks before deployment.

### Securing Dependencies with OWASP Dependency-Check

One of the key steps in ensuring the security of your software is identifying vulnerable third-party libraries.[**OWASP Dependency-Check**](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) is an open-source tool designed to help developers and security professionals automatically identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. By scanning your project’s libraries against the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), it provides reports on any potential risks, making it a crucial part of your DevSecOps pipeline.

Integrating **OWASP Dependency-Check** can significantly enhance your application’s security posture, ensuring you address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in production.

#### Example: OWASP Dependency-Check in Action

For a practical implementation of **OWASP Dependency-Check**, check out this [example script from my GitHub repo](https://github.com/d0uble3L/webapp/blob/master/owasp-dependency-check.sh). This script demonstrates how to integrate Dependency-Check into your pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

OWASPDC_DIRECTORY=$HOME/OWASP-Dependency-Check
DATA_DIRECTORY="$OWASPDC_DIRECTORY/data"
REPORT_DIRECTORY="$OWASPDC_DIRECTORY/reports"

if [ ! -d "$DATA_DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Initially creating persistent directories"
    mkdir -p "$DATA_DIRECTORY"
    chmod -R 777 "$DATA_DIRECTORY"

    mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIRECTORY"
    chmod -R 777 "$REPORT_DIRECTORY"
fi

# Make sure we are using the latest version
docker pull owasp/dependency-check

docker run --rm \
    --volume $(pwd):/src \
    --volume "$DATA_DIRECTORY":/usr/share/dependency-check/data \
    --volume "$REPORT_DIRECTORY":/report \
    owasp/dependency-check \
    --scan /src \
    --format "ALL" \
    --project "My OWASP Dependency Check Project" \
    --out /report
    # Use suppression like this: (/src == $pwd)
    # --suppression "/src/security/dependency-check-suppression.xml"
```

_Code Source: [d0uble3l. webapp/owasp-dependency-check.sh, GitHub.](https://github.com/d0uble3L/webapp/blob/master/owasp-dependency-check.sh)_

By automating these checks, you can ensure continuous security for your application dependencies.

### Checking Git Secrets in Pipeline Using Trufflehog

When securing your CI/CD pipeline, it's essential to scan for sensitive information accidentally committed to your repositories. **Trufflehog** is a powerful regex-based scanning tool designed to detect secrets in your Git history.

#### Example: Trufflehog in Action

You can quickly run **Trufflehog** in a Docker container to scan your Git repository for secrets:

```bash
# Pull the Trufflehog Docker image
docker pull gesellix/trufflehog

# Run Trufflehog on your GitHub repository
docker run gesellix/trufflehog <GIT REMOTE REPO URL>

# Add the user to the Docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

# Change Docker socket permissions
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Restart Jenkins to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```
