# Engineering Security from First Principles

Welcome to **CybersecurityOS**—a resource dedicated to building secure systems by design, not by accident.

I'm Michael Tayo, a cybersecurity strategist based in the USA. I work at the intersection of **security engineering**, **system design**, and **automation**, helping organizations think critically about how to embed security into their technology from the ground up.

## What You'll Find Here

At CybersecurityOS, we explore:

- **Secure-by-design architecture** — Security as a first-class concern, not an afterthought
- **Automation and DevSecOps** — Making security scalable, consistent, and sustainable
- **Cloud security and infrastructure** — Securing systems at scale
- **AI and emerging technologies** — Understanding the security implications of what's next
- **Practical frameworks and strategies** — Actionable insights for security leaders, engineers, and teams

This isn't about fear or complexity. It's about clarity—understanding what systems need to be secure, why, and how to achieve it efficiently.

## Beyond the Blog

I'm working on turning these frameworks and insights into a comprehensive guide on security-first engineering. For now, I share weekly perspectives on cybersecurity, technology trends, and the decisions that shape our digital future.

When I'm not thinking about security architecture, you'll find me exploring the intersections of fitness, travel, music, and food.

Let's build more resilient systems together.
