# Hi, I’m Michael Tayo!

I’m a cybersecurity professional with expertise in Cloud Security, Vulnerability Management, and DevSecOps.

Welcome to my site, where cutting-edge ideas on **cybersecurity**, **automation**, **AI**, and **system design** converge. Here, I explore the ever-evolving world of technology, with a strong focus on **building systems that are secure by design**, ensuring security is embedded at every level.

One day, these insights will become a book. Until then, I invite you to join me as I share thoughts, strategies, and practical solutions for navigating the complex landscape of modern cybersecurity. Together, we’ll uncover new approaches to **protecting systems**, **securing data**, and **shaping the future of tech**.

I’m passionate about learning new technologies, hosting workshops, and sharing my experiences in cybersecurity and automation.

Thanks for stopping by, and see you soon!
